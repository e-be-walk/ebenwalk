## About
This repository is being used to contain my very own portfolio. As I run through different iterations of what I want my portfolio to be like and how I want to present my work and my projects, I decided a github repository would allow me version control and also a way to reference older ideas and projects.

Some of the layout for my portfolio is adjusted from bootstrap templates. Take a look at different Bootstrap Templates here-
