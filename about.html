    <p>Ebenwalk is the concatenation of my name. Eben Walk, little known to me at
      the time of creating my profile and website, is actually a sort of seasonal,
      natural event whereby the Eben Ice Caves are formed in the Hiawatha National
      Forest in Michigan. But enough about that. <br><br>

      I started learning code a while ago. I was working
      in a quiet museum digitizing their collection. The software didn’t do
      exactly what I wanted it to do and my work was seen by only a select few
      colleagues within the museum. I wanted to fix that and I wanted the museum
      to be able to share all my work and their collection with the greater
      public. At the time, I didn't know it would become a passion of mine.<br><br>

      I began to tinker, read all the books, taking all the courses, attending
      every webinar, and listening to every podcast I could. I would have never
      imagined myself here, yet, here I am. Building things, creating
      applications, developing programs! Coding has become my passion and my
      mission.<br><br>

      To check out what I’ve built, head on over to my projects page. To learn
      more about my story and things I've learned check out my <a target="blank" href="https://e-be-walk.github.io/">blog</a>.
